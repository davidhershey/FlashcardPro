  <h2>FlashcardPro</h2>
  <p>EECS493 Winter 2015</p>
  <p>Designed For Mark Ackerman</p>
  <p>Designed By Jared DeFrain, Sam Devaprasad, David Hershey, and Lauren Molley</p>
  <br>
  <p>For our final project, we created a Flashcard application. It allows users to easily create, study, edit, share, and log progress on sets of flashcards.  We focused on making our interface simple and clean, but functional. In addition, we utilized Leitner system to enhance the learning process. The Leitner system is an algorithm that determines the optimal order of displaying flash cards to encourage information retention. This algorithm has been shown to be extremely effective, and by trying to make it more understandable and easier to use we could help people memorize terms much more effectively.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Our program has the capability to store multiple users and their decks. This data will be available locally every time our application is run. When a new user is created, a directory is created to store all future decks. At this time, a tutorial QDialog is also shown. The tutorial is semi-interactive, meaning the user can see and click on windows from the actual application but certain features are disabled. Upon completion of the tutorial, the user is shown our deck selection page. Existing users can access the application without viewing the tutorial, and their decks will preload for them upon selecting their username.</p>
  <br>
  <p>A users decks are organized in a grid and are identified by their deck title. Clicking on a deck opens a modal dialog box that prompts the user to create a deck, load a deck, or cancel. Selecting create a deck sends the user to the Deck Builder, where they are able to assemble their deck of flashcards one card at a time, selecting the front and back text. Flashcards use their front text as an identifier, so a deck cannot have multiple cards with the same front text. Consequently, editing a cards front text will create a new card with the new front text, and the old card should be deleted if it is no longer desired. Existing cards can be selected here and edited or removed from the deck. Once the user saves the deck, it is stored in memory and written to that users folder in a specified format readable by the application. This .dek file can then be copied or moved outside of the application and imported by another user if desired.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Once a deck is created, the deck menu is shown. From this menu, a graphic shows the historical deck score for the particular deck, which is the lowest card score of any card in that deck. This graph plots mastery of the deck over time. There are options to study the deck, edit the deck, or delete the deck. Studying the deck takes the user to the study area, where flashcards are presented in the full application window and clicking on a card will flip it. The user is then responsible for marking each flashcard correct or incorrect by selecting the appropriate buttons. New flashcards will be shown each time a card is marked, and the algorithm will show cards that have been missed more often to facilitate learning. There is no end to the study mode, a user will need to hit the back button the leave the study area.</p>
  <br>
  <p>As shown in the slideshow below we made this application using Qt. Qt had all of the necessary resources needed to develop and test our application on.</p>
